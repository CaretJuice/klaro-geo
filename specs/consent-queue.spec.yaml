# consent-queue.spec.yaml
# Specification for Consent Queue Feature
#
# PURPOSE: Queue dataLayer events until consent state is confirmed

file_meta:
  purpose: "Define contract for klaroGeo.push() consent queue API"
  dependencies:
    - "klaro-geo.js"
    - "klaro-geo-config.php (for GTM ID setting)"
    - "datalayer-events.spec.yaml (Klaro Consent Update)"
  stability: "new"

# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# =============================================================================
problem:
  race_condition: |
    Events fired before consent state is set may:
    - Fire without proper consent context
    - Get dropped by tag manager consent checks
    - Cause compliance issues

  trigger_group_limitation: |
    GTM Trigger Groups require ALL conditions to fire EVERY time:
    - First click: Consent Event + Add to Cart → Tag fires ✓
    - Second click: Add to Cart only → Tag fails ✗

    This makes Trigger Groups unsuitable for repeatable events (add_to_cart,
    form submissions, etc.) - only works for one-time-per-page events.

  solution: |
    A consent-aware queue that holds events until consent state is known,
    then flushes them (or drops them if consent is denied).

# =============================================================================
# GTM CONSENT REQUIREMENT
# =============================================================================
gtm_consent:
  description: |
    GTM is configured as an optional service that requires consent.
    This aligns with European legal interpretations that GTM itself
    enables tracking and therefore requires user consent.

  service_configuration:
    required: false
    default: false
    purposes: ["analytics", "advertising"]

  behavior: |
    - GTM only loads when user consents to analytics OR advertising
    - In Basic mode, 'Klaro Consent Update' is skipped for initialConsents when GTM not consented
    - Queue naturally waits for relevant consent before flushing
    - gtag('consent', 'update') is always called (queues for when GTM loads)

  migration:
    description: |
      Existing installations with old GTM config (required=true,
      purposes=["functional"]) are auto-migrated to the new config.
      Custom configurations are preserved.
    trigger: "klaro_geo_migrate_gtm_consent_requirement on init hook"

# API CONTRACT
# =============================================================================
api:
  namespace: "window.klaroGeo"

  push_method:
    signature: "klaroGeo.push(eventData)"
    description: "Queue an event to be pushed to dataLayer after consent is confirmed"

    parameters:
      eventData:
        type: "object"
        required: true
        description: "Any valid dataLayer event object"
        example:
          event: "view_item_list"
          ecommerce:
            item_list_id: "services_overview"
            items: []

    behavior:
      consent_already_confirmed:
        description: "If consent event has already fired, push immediately to dataLayer"
        action: "window.dataLayer.push(eventData)"

      consent_pending:
        description: "If consent event hasn't fired yet, queue the event"
        action: "Add to internal queue, wait for consent event"

    contract: |
      - MUST accept any valid dataLayer event object
      - MUST push to dataLayer immediately if consent already confirmed
      - MUST queue event if consent pending
      - MUST work before klaro-geo.js fully loads (stub pattern)
      - NOTE: Queue handles TIMING only. GTM consent mode handles consent enforcement.

  stub_pattern:
    description: "Safe to call before main script loads"
    example: |
      // Can be placed anywhere, even before klaro-geo.js loads
      window.klaroGeo = window.klaroGeo || {};
      window.klaroGeo.push = window.klaroGeo.push || function(e) {
          (window.klaroGeo.queue = window.klaroGeo.queue || []).push(e);
      };

      // Safe to call immediately
      klaroGeo.push({ event: 'view_item_list', ... });

# CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
configuration:
  useGTM:
    type: "boolean"
    default: "Auto-detected from klaro_geo_gtm_id OR google-tag-manager service"
    description: "Determines which event to wait for"

    auto_detection:
      description: |
        GTM mode is enabled if EITHER condition is true:
        1. klaro_geo_gtm_id WordPress option is set (standalone GTM), OR
        2. google-tag-manager service exists in klaroConfig.services (GTM as Klaro service)
      gtm_detected: "GTM mode - affects skip logic for initialConsents"
      gtm_not_detected: "Non-GTM mode - no skip logic needed"

    override:
      description: "Manual override for edge cases (multiple tag managers)"
      example: |
        window.klaroGeo.useGTM = false; // Force non-GTM mode

    contract: |
      - MUST check klaro_geo_gtm_id from PHP settings (via klaroConsentData.gtmId)
      - MUST check klaroConfig.services for google-tag-manager service
      - MUST enable GTM mode if EITHER source indicates GTM is configured
      - MUST allow JavaScript override before queue processes

  consentModeType:
    type: "string"
    default: "'basic'"
    values: ["basic", "advanced"]
    description: "Determines how GTM is loaded relative to consent"

    auto_detection:
      description: |
        Consent mode type is read from klaroConsentData.consentModeType,
        which is set by PHP from the klaro_geo_consent_mode_type option.
      basic: "GTM gated by Klaro (type='text/plain', data-name). Standard consent flow."
      advanced: "GTM loads immediately. Consent defaults to denied. GA4 sends cookieless pings."

    override:
      description: "Manual override for edge cases"
      example: |
        window.klaroGeo.consentModeType = 'advanced'; // Force advanced mode

    contract: |
      - MUST read from klaroConsentData.consentModeType
      - MUST default to 'basic' when not specified
      - MUST allow JavaScript override before queue processes

  # Note: queueRespectsConsent was removed in simplification.
  # The queue now always flushes when consent event fires.
  # GTM's consent mode handles whether tags actually fire.

# =============================================================================
# QUEUE BEHAVIOR
# =============================================================================
queue:
  storage:
    location: "window.klaroGeo.queue"
    type: "array"
    description: "Internal array of queued event objects"

  size_limit:
    max_events: 100
    on_limit_exceeded:
      action: "Drop oldest event, add new event"
      logging: "console.warn() with message about queue limit"

    contract: |
      - MUST enforce 100 event limit
      - MUST drop oldest events when limit exceeded (FIFO overflow)
      - MUST log warning when limit is hit

  page_load_reset:
    behavior: "Queue resets on each page navigation"
    rationale: "Standard WordPress behavior, fresh page = fresh state"

    contract: |
      - MUST start with empty queue on page load
      - Queue state does NOT persist across navigations

  flush_trigger:
    event: "Klaro Consent Update"
    source: "Plugin pushes this directly after calling gtag('consent', 'update')"
    note: |
      Unified trigger for both GTM and non-GTM modes.
      The plugin now calls gtag('consent', 'update') directly and then pushes
      'Klaro Consent Update' to the dataLayer. No intermediary event needed.
      In GTM Basic mode, the event is skipped for initialConsents when GTM
      hasn't been consented to yet (prevents premature queue flush).

    contract: |
      - MUST always listen for 'Klaro Consent Update' regardless of GTM mode
      - MUST flush queue when trigger event fires
      - In GTM Basic mode, queue effectively waits for consent because 'Klaro Consent Update' is only pushed after consent

  stale_event_prevention:
    description: |
      In GTM Basic mode, 'Klaro Consent Update' is NOT pushed for
      'initialConsents' if the google-tag-manager service has not been consented
      to yet. This prevents premature queue flush before GTM loads.
      gtag('consent', 'update') is still called (queues in dataLayer for when GTM loads).

      Exception: In Advanced Consent Mode, GTM loads immediately (not gated by
      Klaro), so the skip is bypassed and 'Klaro Consent Update' is always pushed.

    behavior:
      basic_mode_new_user_no_consent:
        - Page loads, no Klaro cookie
        - Consent defaults set via gtag('consent', 'default') in <head>
        - initialConsents fires with all services denied
        - gtag('consent', 'update') called (queued for GTM)
        - Klaro Consent Update is SKIPPED (GTM not consented, prevents premature queue flush)
        - User grants consent to analytics/advertising
        - GTM loads (now has consent)
        - saveConsents fires with updated consent state
        - gtag('consent', 'update') called + Klaro Consent Update pushed
        - Queue flushes

      basic_mode_returning_user_with_consent:
        - Page loads, Klaro cookie present with consent
        - Consent defaults set via gtag('consent', 'default') in <head>
        - initialConsents fires with saved consent state
        - gtag('consent', 'update') called + Klaro Consent Update pushed
        - GTM loads immediately, processes queued consent update
        - Queue flushes

      advanced_mode_new_user:
        - Page loads → GTM loads immediately (no Klaro gating)
        - Consent defaults set via gtag('consent', 'default') in <head>
        - Klaro initializes → initialConsents fires
        - gtag('consent', 'update') called + Klaro Consent Update pushed (skip bypassed)
        - Queue flushes. GA4 sends cookieless pings
        - User consents → saveConsents
        - gtag('consent', 'update') called + Klaro Consent Update pushed
        - Tags with consent requirements fire

    contract: |
      - MUST skip 'Klaro Consent Update' for initialConsents in Basic GTM mode when GTM not consented
      - MUST NOT skip 'Klaro Consent Update' for initialConsents in Advanced mode
      - MUST always push 'Klaro Consent Update' for saveConsents
      - MUST always push 'Klaro Consent Update' when GTM is already consented
      - MUST always call gtag('consent', 'update') regardless of skip condition

  queue_flushed_event:
    description: |
      Lightweight timing visibility event pushed after the consent queue drains.
      Only fires when the queue had events to flush (not on empty queue).
    event_shape:
      event: "Klaro Event"
      eventSource: "klaro-geo"
      klaroEventName: "queueFlushed"
      queueSize: "Number of events that were flushed"
    contract: |
      - MUST fire after all queued events have been pushed to dataLayer
      - MUST include the count of flushed events as queueSize
      - MUST NOT fire when the queue is empty
      - MUST use eventSource 'klaro-geo' (this is a plugin-generated event)

  consent_state_tracking:
    variables:
      consentConfirmed:
        type: "boolean"
        default: false
        description: "Set to true when consent event fires"

    contract: |
      - MUST track whether consent event has fired
      - MUST handle both initial page load and subsequent consent changes

# =============================================================================
# TEST SCENARIOS
# =============================================================================
test_scenarios:
  critical:
    - "klaroGeo.push() works before klaro-geo.js loads (stub pattern)"
    - "Events queue when consent not yet confirmed"
    - "Queued events flush on Klaro Consent Update (unified trigger)"
    - "Events push immediately after consent confirmed"
    - "Queue respects 100 event limit"
    - "Oldest events dropped when limit exceeded"
    - "Warning logged when limit exceeded"
    - "Queue flushes when consent event fires (regardless of consent state)"
    - "useGTM auto-detected from klaro_geo_gtm_id setting"
    - "useGTM auto-detected from google-tag-manager service in klaroConfig"
    - "useGTM can be overridden via JavaScript"
    - "Klaro Consent Update (initialConsents) is skipped in Basic GTM mode when GTM not consented"
    - "Klaro Consent Update (initialConsents) is NOT skipped in Advanced mode"
    - "consentModeType detected from klaroConsentData"
    - "consentModeType defaults to basic when not specified"
    - "consentModeType can be overridden via JavaScript"

  edge_cases:
    - "Empty queue on consent event (nothing to flush)"
    - "Multiple consent events (only first should trigger flush)"
    - "Queue starts empty on each page load"
    - "Stub pattern preserves events added before main script"
    - "GTM mode detected with only google-tag-manager service (no klaro_geo_gtm_id)"
    - "All modes use Klaro Consent Update as flush trigger (unified)"
    - "Klaro Consent Data does NOT flush queue (deprecated event)"

future:
  event_deduplication:
    status: "Deferred"
    description: |
      Add event removal tool that removes repeating events caused by
